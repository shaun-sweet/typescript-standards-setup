## The Standard

The focus of the standards will be to infer types, not create excessive annotations. The document that started these standards is here:

[https://github.com/piotrwitek/react-redux-typescript-guide](https://github.com/piotrwitek/react-redux-typescript-guide)

There will be sections that will adhere and diverge from the guide above. In all cases, this standards document supersedes the guide.

The plan is for this document to live over time and adjust to current best practices.

## Philosophy

The idea for Typescript useage within the React ecosystem is simple.  *Prefer type inferrence*.  No one *wants* to have a messy project full of type interfaces all over.  We can leverage type inferrence in order to gain **complete type saftey** throughout the entire application.  We find this quote to do a good job explaining the philosophy:

> "This guide is a living compendium documenting the most important patterns and recipes on how to use React (and its Ecosystem) in a functional style using TypeScript. It will help you make your code completely type-safe while focusing on inferring the types from implementation so there is less noise coming from excessive type annotations and it's easier to write and maintain correct types in the long run."

Ok, we'll trust you're convinced!  Lets continue...
